# Bubble Sort
![Bubble Sort Example](./Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif)


## About the Project
In this project, we built a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array without using #sort method.

Also, we created a method #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array by accepting a block using yield.

In #bubble_sort_by, the block will have two arguments that represent the two elements of the array that are currently being compared. The block‚Äôs return will be similar to the spaceship operator.
We implemented the bubble sort algorithm using yield and passing a block to a method.
